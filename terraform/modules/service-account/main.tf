// DEPRECATED: per-project `service-account` implementation removed.
// The canonical OCI implementation now lives in the mono repo:
//   all-infrastructure/terraform/modules/service-account
// This file is intentionally left as a simple placeholder to indicate
// that provider-specific module code was relocated to the central repo.
// Remove this file or the entire `terraform/modules` directory once all
// teams and CI pipelines are switched to the shared modules.
